# Hi, I'm Jiya! 

## About Me
- High school senior at Marin Academy
- Teaching myself Python through "vibe coding" with Claude
- Also: ballet dancer, lab tech assistant, and chemistry tutor

## What I'm Learning
I've been figuring out how to build software with AI (specifically Claude), and I wrote up what I learned:
- **[My Vibe Coding Learnings](https://gist.github.com/jiyagangwar742/4a4d1b62bb3c53e70c37f12863848e75)** - Tips for building code with Claude.

## My Current Projects Developed with [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/)
**[Fruit Fly Genetics Tracker](https://github.com/jiyagangwar742/fruit_fly_tracker)**  
Python tool to:
- Predict what offspring will occur from genetic crosses
- Record actual experimental observations
- Analyze whether the results match genetic theory
- Visualize data with charts like Punnett Square Diagram,Stacked Bar Chart, Genotype Network Diagram, Allele Frequency Pie Charts etc
- Track multiple experiments over time

**[Stoichiometry Solver](https://github.com/jiyagangwar742/stoichiometrysolver)**  
- Python tool for chemistry calculations
